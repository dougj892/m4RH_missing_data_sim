# Test approaches to missing data in m4RH
I created this new repository because the previous baseline repository was on a shared drive which was probably not a great idea.  This repository includes do files used to perform analysis for the Nigeria baseline report


## Folder Structure
Scripts are organized into the following folders:
- **Cleaning** Scripts which generate clean versions of raw data files
- **Randomization** Scripts which randomly assign facilities to treatment.  
- **Analysis** All other scripts including scripts for performing data cleaning and other analysis.

## To do
- Estimate covariance matrix
